  <h1>Application</h1>
<p>Manicurists start with the same techniques as for the manicure or pedicure:</p>
  <p>Acrylics: a chemical mixture of monomer liquid and polymer powder that can be directly applied on the nails or on artificial nails, also called nail extensions or enhancements.</p>
   <p> Nail gel: a chemical combination similar to acrylics, also known as shellac nails. Manicurist applies several layers on the fingernails or/and toenails and lets it cure under a UV or LED light. When the gel is fixed, it hardens the nails. The gel is also typical in a polish form known as gel polish, and, like other forms of gel, it also requires a UV or LED light to cure. The difference between acrylic and gel is that acrylic dries naturally, but gel needs UV light to cure. Similarly, where regular nail polish will dry naturally, the gel polish will remain tacky until cured by a UV light.</p>  
   <p>Nail polish/nail varnish: a lacquer applied to finger and toenails to protect or as a base color. Nail manicurists also use a base coat to protect and strengthen nails and prevent natural nails from yellowing or staining.</p>
