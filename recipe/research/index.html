                You need butter. Regular, salted butter.
                FYI, I never use unsalted butter except in the occasional cake or cookie recipe. But cooking? NEVER!
                Cream. Heavy cream. Not milk. Not half and half. 
                You need plenty of Parmesan cheese. Aside from the obvious inconvenience of making me go up a jean size,<br>
                I love Fettuccine Alfredo because it allows me to clean my fridge out of all the miscellaneous Parmesan pieces.
                You’ll also need…Fettuccine!
                <p>
                    I’ve talked before about my weakness when it comes to collecting fancy, artisan dried pasta. It hasn’t gotten any better.<br>


Okay, go ahead and grate the Parmesan. You’ll need about 2 cups.<br>


Bring a pot of water to a boil for the pasta, and cook the pasta until al dente.<br>


Then grab a skillet or saucepan and set it over medium-low heat. (Low if your stove gets hot.)<br>


Melt 1 stick of butter in the skillet…<br>


Then pour in an equal amount of cream.<br>


You might as well just surrender and let this happen. <br>


Whisk it together gently, and just allow the mixture to warm up and get happy.<br>


At this point, I’ll season the sauce a bit—a dash of salt (though with all the Parmesan, it doesn’t need much), plenty of freshly ground black pepper. <br>
I don’t like to do much more than that, as the standalone flavor of the Parmesan is enough!
I do sometimes sprinkle in just a little bit of nutmeg if I’m not making it for my girl. But she’s not a big fan of nutmeg in savory dishes. <br>
Just before the pasta is ready, stick in a metal measuring cup and retrieve some of the pasta water. We’ll use it later to thin the sauce if it’s a little gloopy.<br>
Now, grab a big serving bowl. We’re just gonna do this right here.<br>
Sprinkle half the Parmesan right into the bowl.<br>
Then just pour the warm, creamy butter/cream mixture right in.<br>
Don’t stir it. Just let it sit and get acquainted.<br>
Now drain the pasta…<br>
And immediately pour it, steaming hot, right into the bowl with the other ingredients.<br>
Then, with tongs, gently toss it to combine.<br>
After you give it a couple of tosses, sprinkle in the rest of the Parmesan.<br>
For obvious reasons, this is really fun to make for company. Just mix it all up right at the dinner table!<br>
Important: if it gets overly thick and gloopy, splash in some of the warm pasta water. It’ll bring it to the perfect consistency.<br>
I give it a sprinkle of black pepper just before serving. You could certainly sprinkle it with chopped parsley or chives…but I really like just leaving it unadulterated.
